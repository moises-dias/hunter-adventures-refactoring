# Hunter adventures Refactoring

### This repository was created to refactor an existing C++ project called hunter adventures. 


The Hunter Adventures game was made by me and a colleague in 2017 in the first year of my graduation as a computer engineer, where I had been programming in C++ for less than 3 months at the time and did not know good software development practices.

After studying clean code, solid principles, git flow, and code refactoring, I decided to apply this knowledge to an existing code, which is the purpose of this repository.
